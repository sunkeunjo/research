I booked a stay for a healthcare conference I was supposed to attend in May of 2020 . Due to the current pandemic , the conference is being moved to a different date and location . I called the hotel and tried to cancel my room but they are refusing to refund me because I did the prepay rate . I did the prepay rate because the conference rate wasn ’ t available and I only get a certain amount of money for continuing education from my employer . I am very upset that they aren ’ t doing anything to help when the conference is cancelled . I ’ m a healthcare provider and I am appalled at the lack of care or consideration . I have been on hold for over 20 minutes and no one has helped me . Both agents I ’ ve spoken to have been incredibly rude . Have a heart . This is out of my control . I had every intention of attending the conference but it ’ s been changed so I don ’ t see why they can ’ t just cancel my reservation and refund me given the circumstances . Missing my Hyatt family . Looking forward to getting back to work when this is over . I love Hyatt , God bless us all to return soon . Missed our # parkhyattmackapalas stay this month- but we will go back ! ! 💙 They 've fired employees with no warning during this pandemic rather than supporting them with the billions of dollars in their pockets . My family is now facing possible homelessness because of their greed . We 've lost everything because the Hyatt does n't care about its employees or their fake morals .",0.9998,0.361,0.059,0.58,hyatt,5
"Good Morning ! I have a Hyatt Place Miami Airport-West / Doral reservation for June 1 , 2020 . This reservation was made through a reservation website in Brazil , without cancellation . I would like to know if the hotel has a policy of not accepting guests and until when would that date be ? Because I need to know if the hotel is open or closed to the public to request a cancellation free of charge because it is not my fault that I probably should not travel remembering the situation that the world is experiencing due to COVID -19 . I await reply . Hello ! So that we can properly and securely assist you , please message us directly from Facebook or Twitter . Thanks for caring 💜 Our customers care is our concerns . ♥️ How is it that your website ’ s statement said that due to covid-19 that you will allow refund for hotel bookings and waive fees before 24 hours but yet refused to honor my cancellation request . You took $ 2,000 from me during a period of global crisis . Hello ! Right now , the temporary policy in place is for arrivals before April 30th . Please DM with your reservation details if your reservation is before April 30th . ^TH it is for before 4/30 . In fact it is for tomorrow . does not exist .

If not , and you 'd like to send a DM or PM through FB or Twitter with the reservation details , please use our handle . Sorry for the confusion ! ^TH I just got off the phone with a customer service representative for the same exact reason and they told me they could n't do anything . The date is 3/28 and I booked through the Hyatt website . VERY DISAPPOINTED with Hyatt service . Hello ! Can you please send us a DM on Instagram or a private message on Facebook with your stay details so we can look into this further ? I just sent a message to this account . Hyatt is not care about health and safety . All the hotels ( Fairmont , Marriott ... ) welcome all the cancellations , non refundables too . But Hyatt punishing people cause of a pandemic disease !

Congratulations to Hyatt for being in touch with - and providing assistance to - all members / guests . Hyatt has exceptional customer service if you call main number and treat the person who is trying to help you with decency and respect . Amazing people at Hyatt and Delta helped me unwind a week in Paris at Hyatt Louvre so I lost nothing . In a nick if time too . Same love for Delta . do you know when you might be making a decision on events such as weddings held at your hotels the beginning of May ? We are being told fully schedule but that falls out of CDC guidelines of no more than 10 people for 60days . Struggling with determine option when all hotel managers abide by different regulations . Any ideas ? Hello ! Please private message us with your information , so that we can further assist you.-CF can you confirm if prepaid rates are able to be changed or canceled without penalty ?

I really wish I could have stayed with you later this month but thankful that you 're putting people 's safety first . Thanks ! ❤️❤️ Stay safe everyone My experience with customer service was not good at all . My family had plans to travel to Georgia for my sons tournament but due to the Coronavirus crisis the tournament was canceled . I made sure to call right away to cancel my reservation which was more than 24 hours before i was due to check in . They still charged me a night plus fees , I feel due to whats happening they should be more understanding . The Manager ( Michael ) from the hotel and his assistance ( Brittney ) were very rude and they seemed not to care for what I had to say . I tried calling several times and despite hearing over the recording of the Hotel that they were willing to wave the fee due to the Coronavirus they are not refunding me the money . All i got was points , I will never stay at this hotel . This experience was bad and I will make sure my family and friends will never reserve with them . I will stay with this company even more and make sure all my friends know to stay here as well because of your comment . 😂😂now that ’ s just beyond pathetic on your half . Grow up Shut up fake account . are employees being offered PAID sick leave ? ? # hyattcares no , they only told us we are laid off until further notice and to apply for unemployment since they can ’ t do anything about it . im sorry . very sad . billionaires have no empathy for “ normal ” people # profitsbeforepeople it is unfortunate , they told us our property will be close approximately two months . It ’ s devastating to work for a billion dollar company and they can ’ t even bother paying us during this time of need . It clearly shows how much they value us . furloughed is better than what we got . Outright fired , no option to return for us . .v.e.r.y.s.i I am so sorry to hear about that , that is devastating . I pray for you and everyone else affected by this tragedy . From what I hear , they 're not compensating employees for their impacted work schedules due to coronavirus ... ☹️ they 've fired my partner . We 've lost everything . My grandfather is 79 he called to reschedule or cancel his stay and he was told he could not and will loose his money and all his points ! ! ! any one that can help they have chronic diseases and due to the corona they did not want to be exposed . please respond My personal experience with Hyatt is that they don ’ t really care about their loyalty members . The seems care on the surface but when you experience deeper they are not . So since my bad experience I have switched from Hyatt to Marriott which truly cares . Have fun staying at a cheaper , less stylish , and less awesome hotel chain ! firing people right now while the is an epidemic going on is not helping the safety of people STOP FIRING EMPLOYEES DURING THIS VIRUS . We 've lost everything because of your greed . My experience with customer service was not good at all . My family Great reason . `` My family ... '' lol keep rolling down n you ’ ll see why ... obviously i didn ’ t finish smfh Delete your mistake comment then . 😒 Except giving refunds in lieu of the pandemic ? ! I ’ m appalled that Hyatt and especially Andaz has this stance . I paid over $ 4,000 for a 4 night stay and am told no refunds ? Shame on Andaz ! exactly ! ! ! ! They should be ashamed help us ! ! ! ! ! ! the ceo addressed shareholders about share price dropping before any mention of safety/wellbeing to guests/colleagues # greed Worst of the worst hotel How you guys charge for breakfast and not have option to have fry eggs lol on top food is expensive for the portion you offer ! Disappointed . the story of and https : //commercialobserver.com/2020/03/how-donald-trump-got-his-start-with-the-grand-hyatt/ Love your brand . Just wanted to say , we had to cancel a trip overseas due to no ability to return home ... I would LOVE to have a stay-cation in my own city as I hear you ’ re sending people home due to no bookings ... but for an empty hotel prices have not moved ? I ’ m still looking over $ 300 for a night in Sydney . Do some stay-cation incentive for people who just want to get out of the house I ’ m sure people will come . We don ’ t have a lock-in here . And we never stay in hotels in our home town but would love to if the price made sense . DO NOT SUPPORT HYATT . THEYRE LAYING OFF EMPLOYEES INSTEAD OF SUPPORTING THEM THROUGH THIS CRISIS . WE HAVE LOST OUR ONLY INCOME BECAUSE OF THIS GREED . and family worth over $ 29BILLION ! ! ! ! 💰💰💰💰💰 You guys are still open ? ? ? 🤣🤣🤣 ",0.9995,0.3,0.153,0.547,hyatt,6

I ’ m appalled that Hyatt and especially Andaz has this stance . I paid over $ 4,000 for a 4 night stay and am told no refunds ? Shame on Andaz ! exactly ! ! ! ! They should be ashamed help us ! ! ! ! ! ! the ceo addressed shareholders about share price dropping before any mention of safety/wellbeing to guests/colleagues # greed Worst of the worst hotel How you guys charge for breakfast and not have option to have fry eggs lol on top food is expensive for the portion you offer ! Disappointed . the story of and https : //commercialobserver.com/2020/03/how-donald-trump-got-his-start-with-the-grand-hyatt/ Love your brand . Just wanted to say , we had to cancel a trip overseas due to no ability to return home ... I would LOVE to have a stay-cation in my own city as I hear you ’ re sending people home due to no bookings ... but for an empty hotel prices have not moved ? I ’ m still looking over $ 300 for a night in Sydney . Do some stay-cation incentive for people who just want to get out of the house I ’ m sure people will come . We don ’ t have a lock-in here . And we never stay in hotels in our home town but would love to if the price made sense . DO NOT SUPPORT HYATT . THEYRE LAYING OFF EMPLOYEES INSTEAD OF SUPPORTING THEM THROUGH THIS CRISIS . WE HAVE LOST OUR ONLY INCOME BECAUSE OF THIS GREED . and family worth over $ 29BILLION ! ! ! ! 💰💰💰💰💰 You guys are still open ? ? ? 🤣🤣🤣 ",0.9995,0.3,0.153,0.547,hyatt,6
"# MiravalMoments # Wellbeing # MiravalResorts 😍 😊 Lovely 💜 .escapes thanks ! Please consider updating your cancellation policy to extend refunds to advance payment reservations due to this outbreak . other hotels are offering refunds and Hyatt is offering a $ 150 credit . It is unfair Points shouldn ’ t expire ! I just lost my points because I didn ’ t stay at your place 😂 POINTS SHOULD NOT EXPIRE Hi there ! Points actually do not have an expiration date . You would just need to have some type of activity ( point movement ) at least once every 24 consecutive months in order to not forfeit the points within your account . Please feel free to visit our website for more information . Hello Hyatt ! What do you mean by `` point movement ? '' Just logging into your account within 24 months ? Or redeeming ( or adding to ) your points within 24 months , or they would be forfeited ? The latter Would essentially be the equivalent of expiring a persons earned points in 24 months of inactivity . That would be a 💩y practice . There is a pandemic and you guys won ’ t offer refunds to people who can ’ t travel . Truly terrible service . Not to mention incredibly irresponsible . My grandfather is 79 he called to reschedule or cancel his stay and he was told he could not and will loose his money and all his points ! ! ! any one that can help they have chronic diseases and due to the corona they did not want to be exposed .

"# Hyatt # WorldOfHyatt ❤️ 😊  😍😍😍 and ? yes please 😍😍 Tried to cancel my hotel in Seattle but instead they refused to refund me and told me to still come .

They keep saying since two weeks away I ’ m good . 🙅🏻‍♂️ I had to complain 40 times to them but they finally asked for my email , emailed me and said they would give 10,000 points for future use . Still not good enough IMO . I bet this offer has only gone out to select people who have complained a lot like myself . Even though it seemed like a broad distribution . I finally got my refund ! I had to ask about 50 times though . yes , and the points are all forfeited if people do n't use within 24 months . So shady . heard they are finally now going to issue refunds to everyone .

"# WorldofHyatt # FINDauction # FINDexperience Lovely 💜 .escapes 😊  Dear Hyatt Team , This email is regarding the poor customer experience during the stay at Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile . I checked in on 25 Feb and check out on 29 Feb . This was my honeymoon trip and Paris was my last destination and your team has messed up all thing . I have paid approximately 1000 Euro for the booking . Below is my experience day wise : Day 1 : I asked for the glasses and ice in my room , and i got the answer that go to the SKY bar they will give you the ice and glass . Is this the way hat you are going to treat the customers Day 3. : I returned from the Disneyland around 9 PM and found that the room was not properly cleaned . The dustbin was not empty , the table was dirty etc . Then I complaint the room service and they get the room clean again and apologise me for the same . Day : 4 I returned from the city tour and found that the door was opened of my room , there was the tag on door handle please make my room & cleaning was not proper again even after the yesterday complaint . I can not understand why the door was open and this was such a big negligence on your part and the room was not properly cleaned . I complaint the same at the reception then assistant front lobby manager came and he apologised me for the inconvenience and asked me that if I required anything , I simply asked for the English breakfast tea pouches along with the creamer and sugar in my room . He said that I am sending you this in few minutes and you know that few minutes actually never came . In morning at 7:30 AM I have to again call the room serve for the same . Is this how you treat your customers . I booked this property because of the brand name but it was my wrong decision . I will post my reviews on online platform also so that other customers can get the clear picture of what you show and what you actually deliver . We are very sorry to hear of your experience . As we are unable to assist via this channel , please send an email to consumeraffairs.com so we can follow up with you regarding your stay issues .",0.7717,0.153,0.116,0.731,hyatt,15

Is it because I was a single female traveler ? Or someone without money for an attorney ? , Katie at Customer Support sent me an email saying the matter would be “ investigated ” . I had to have 3 VERY lengthy calls with Hyatt to get that , which is of course just a standard letter to pacify guests in the hikes they ’ ll get busy with their lives and not take care of themselves . I never heard back . I sent her an email requesting an update and never heard back . I sent another email tonight which bounced back to me . I can see how “ important ” your guests are to you .

My sister who is CELIAC received a dessert that had assured her that it was gluten free , and it turned out not to be . I have all the photos . Medical tests . The hotel really behaved badly . They were not even able to buy the prescribed medicines , which we asked for the favor , because we were not in condition . We were both suffering the consequences for more than a week . Why do I complain now ? Because at that time I was not in a position to enter on a battle . But I want you to know that despite having been informed Mr. Paupy , the Hotel never lived up to the circumstances . And every time I pass by I feel that unpleasant feeling and lack of education on behalf of the Duhau Palace . I hope some day they do something to repair such luck of respect to their own clients . Hello ! We would be happy to look into this situation on your behalf .

"Love Hyatt but had an awful experience at Hyatt Pike in Long Beach and will never return to that location ! We are sorry to learn of your experience Please direct message us with more information so we can help you furhter . So this is still happening in India . My friends and I were at the Hyatt at 3am to eat and after that we were walking out and I had a rose in my hand from a friend who bought it from a kid selling roses outside a club we were at . The Hyatt security guy at the door tried to stop me saying I cant take the rose , to which I replied I got it from outside . By this time my friends were already in the cab waiting for me , so I got in too . Then another security guy came in front of our cab and asked us to get down and that we cant go without paying for the rose ! So I got down and asked to speak to the manager . Meanwhile the cab driver thought I had stolen something from the hotel so he asked my friends to get down from the cab . Then we were there for a long time talking to Seisa who said she was the manager . After almost an hour another guy walks in saying he ’ s the main manager and tried to pacify us asking if we want coffee or water after accusing me of stealing a rose ! After what felt like hours of humiliation , since there were guests walking in and out and were wondering if I actually maybe walked out without paying the bill or something of that equation , they eventually tried to get out of this situation by offering to drop us back in their hotel car . When I said I felt discriminated and racial profiled the manager decides to be cheeky by saying we have staff from the Northeast in our hotel . “ We are not racist ” Much to their dismay the Christmas tree that they thought I stole the rose from wasn ’ t even made of roses . It was made of red pine cones . At that hour we didn ’ t know what we wanted to make of the situation as we were exhausted and just wanted to go home and sleep . But today I know that what happened last night was wrong . And if I remain silent , many others who don ’ t fit their profile will be charged and faced with similar situation like we did . All this fuss over a rose ! After spending so much at dinner and my friends being a regular at their many restaurants , even if I had taken ONE rose , was this scene really necessary ? ! Feel the racism ! 😂😂 We take these matters very seriously . Please DM us with the property this took place at so that we can review further . They somehow have conveniently ignored the DMs and story tags . Kindly check you DM , its all mentioned there . # hyattregencydelhi Hyatt 's are great",0.854,0.183,0.144,0.673,hyatt,98

"I have been on hold today for 20 minutes for the front desk of the Hyatt House Washington DC Wharf . They just keep picking and putting me back on hold . I ’ ve left 4 messages for Assistant Manager Michael Reeve . Every time I have called he is supposedly out of the office . I ’ ve been trying to talk to someone about a reservation for 10 days . Is there anyone in management that will talk to me ? Anyone answering the phones today ? We would be happy to assist . For security , we would need you to private message us your stay details , and how we can further assist.^JH I have stayed at this Hyatt hotel in Long Beach for nearly 30 years , 3 times a year . I ’ ve never once had a problem there and have enjoyed staying at this hotel until this incident . I was clearly wrongly charged a different rate for my room . After numerous talks with managers and Hyatt care on the phone I have come to the conclusion that Hyatt does not care at all about its loyal customers . Not only have I called multiple times about this incident but they did not call me back about this issue ever . I was promised this issue getting resolved by management and they treat their loyal customers like crap and can ’ t even get a call back to fix their problems . This is the last time I will stay at Hyatt Long Beach after almost 100 stays and I , my employees and everyone else that attends the convention connected to this hotel will know of the mistreatment that occurred between Hyatt and a loyal customer .

The only thing they did was refund my account and stated we fixed our mistake we don ’ t owe you anything . If I would have never called to confirm my stay I wouldn ’ t have any room to stay in . I am so pissed I am going back to from now on .

"👍 This is so dope 👊🏼 😊👍 Top ! El dia 25 de agosto de 2018 , fuí víctima de un robo en el Hyatt House Miami Airport , donde alguien se introdujo a mi habitación , rompió mis 8 maletas y sustrajo prendas de valor , dinero , y ropa y zapatos nuevos que habia comprado ese día . La gerencia del hotel , fue amable , pero ineficiente , porque ya han pasado dos meses y aun no he obtenido repuesta alguna de parte de ustedes . Ya hice mis comentarios en booking.com y ahora los haré en tripadvisor , porque no es comprensible tanta desatención . La policía fué al hotel esa noche y realicé la denuncia , pero en el hotel no hay cámaras de seguridad y nadie me ha informado que fué lo que pasó . We are sorry to learn of this .

Extremely incorrect work of the staff . The security service obtrusively offers services of women of easy virtue . I think for Bishkek Hyatt the name `` red-light hotel '' with three stars is more appropriate '' Hyatt plans to host an Act for America conference . This is the country ’ s largest anti-Muslim group and is labeled as a hate group . How is is it that many other hotel chains have been able to avoid serving white supremacist groups but Hyatt can not stand for the diversity they claim to champion ? why are you providing a safe space to hate groups like Act For America ?

"Already got mine ! Thanks Hyatt ! # worldofhyattcreditcard 🤗 Is the card metal ? card is not metal unfortunately , they sure made it look like it is on the pictures 🙁 Finally ! I ’ ve been waiting for a refresh to this program So do use card holders of the old cars need to do anything to get the new card ? great question ! Please call the phone number on the back of your current card and our Customer Service team will issue the new World of Hyatt credit card . 👍 too bad that the card is not available in Europe 👎🏻 or that you don ’ t have a european program.. How late does the event go ? just something to post next week if you need something I have a good screenshot of the benefits ! : ) Upgraded yesterday . New card is strong . Hyatt wake up ! Be fair to the European world of Hyatt members . I ask for a Hyatt credit-card since 9 years now.. What happens since that long time period ? In the meantime i have ordert a DKB Hilton honors credit-card which give you the gold status after you order the card and the Hilton diamond status after 20.000 euro sales per year . I use this card for payment in all Hyatt hotels as my personal protest I had such a great time at this launch event - so many amazing things to do there - the foods , the massage , yoga , and the secret reward behind the doors ! ! Hi friend who do I talk to about daily fees !

"paint a picture of a horse , not the horse itself . This can -and should be- considered animal cruelty . Please stop promoting this . As you can see from the comments above , it is n't doing any favors to the brand either . I 'm traveller and a travel consultant in Brazil , and finding this very dubious on If it 's a Nice experience or Just a way to sell something that is not actually good for both ways . I 'd like to know more about this and even see If i 'll offering this kind If thing , or Cross the hotel out . 👎🏼 WTF is this garbage . Disappointed in you , Hyatt . just wait till you hear about how they break into cars in the parking lot in the middle of the night . Paint horse ? ? ? Why hyatt why ! ! ! ! - it 's to distract people from the story that people at the Hyatt illegally search your vehicle . , you didn ’ t think this one through . Wtf Paint a horse , we raid through your car at 3 in the morning , for no justified reason , and when asked about it we will tell you it 's our right and to go away , walk a tightrope any comment about a night manger going through someone ’ s personal Lamborghini at the Hyatt Dallas last night ? That should never happen . You guys need to sort your staff out . 🤯 Does the horse get searched in the parking lot at 3 a.m. at your property too ? Or is that just patrons motorized vehicles in valet ? 🔵🔵🔵 Fuck you Hyatt . Why do n't you send over a manager , I 'll conduct an unauthorized search of their large colon Oh man that sounds cool ! I ca n't wait to do this while you illegally search my property ! Get all your stuff ripped out of you car in their parking lots across America .   you guys are fuckin scum bags and so are your employees how much to drive your guests lmabos Bankruptcy in 3.2.1. dont fuck with people 's lambos . Fuckin clowns Privacyyyyyy Shitty hotels and shitty employees don ’ t recommend Fuck Hyatt Shittest hotel Never again . Clearly violated that guests privacy and your response is insulting . Look at post about how you guys violated there privacy by breaking into there car You like invading people 's personal property # noprivacy # noprivacyathyatt Trash ... . I catch you going thru my shit.. no excuse needed 👊👊👊👊👊👊👊✋✌👌👊 Last time I stay there are you gon na have one of your valet ride that horse at 3am without the owners permission I sure as hell am never staying at one of your places . Illegally searching my shit just because you feel like it . that horse looks sketchy as shit . Better conduct and illegal search real quick . Scum bags . Why would we ever give our business to an agency who is okay with illegally searching our private property Just wondering if you guys let all your managers go through peoples personal vehicles at 3 am with no reason . Or if that ’ s only ? ? ? So do you guys let anyone search your guest ’ s cars ? Bullshit So , I wonder how much stuff is “ missing ” for valeted cars since your employees seem to have the right to just go through cars at 3am . Maybe a # metoo moment for everyone missing shit from their cars after staying at one of your places ? ! ? ! ? ! Fuck you talk done did it now caught your ads now ! ! So you guys have a policy of letting your employees illegally search your customers cars ? Illegally searching cars and now painting horses ... who is in charge ? really gon na stay quiet about your employees illegally searching customers vehicles in the middle of the night ? I know this hasn ’ t happened to just one persons car because your manager seems to know what they are talking about when it comes to them getting caught in the act So what ’ s up with breaking into people ’ s cars in the middle of the night ? Is that your standard business practice ? # BoyCottHyatt I can not believe you are defending your employees actions after they looked into a guest car parked in valet all because a cop wanted to check it out cause it was a lambo ? You need to put all your valet through training and with lawyers informing the employees of customers rights . Your employees had a duty to tell the curious cop no . I will NEVER stay at your hotels . What 's next letting a cop into a guest room without a warrant ? Did you thoroughly search this horse at 3am ? # jackasses 👎 searching people ’ s personal property is invasion of privacy . At least we now know where not to stay . First you invade someone ’ s privacy then abuse a horse ? Come on you retards ! ! ! ! Cool ! I was at the Hyatt place in 2016 it was great ! For a hockey tournament Dear Mark Hoplamazian , ask Dave if he remembers the signature # timburton # wynonaryder # piebald # fugazi # thepixies # u2 # weezer # thestrokes # modestmouse # pattismith 1980s style , black , ballet slipper that indie rock girls like Ida and Ani used to wear ? Those are much more comfortable for female employees feet than high heels .

I had a confirmation number and everything . I got to the hotel last night and they didn ’ t have a room for me . They offered me a room an hour away after a day if traveling . Then I refused and the manager offered me a cot in one of your conference rooms ! ! ! ! The common . I work for had 20 rooms at the hotel last night . Then to top it off the manager embarrassed me by calling security and threatening to call the police even though I never raised my voice once nor used profanity . I am appalled by the disrespect and lack of professionalism your hotel showed me and our business will look at other options in the Future . Shame on you . Once things became confrontational I began to record . Still considering sharing that footage . Paint a horse . Um , no . i can ’ t wait to see a pic of you doing this 😉 😂😂😂 girl I wanted to but wouldn ’ t budge on that one 😑🐴 .fernandez4 esto no es nada bueno no ? 🤔 white people 👎 blocked . 🙊 😂😂 Paint a horse 🐎 😂😂😂 ich bin froh wenn ich meine mal sauber krieg 😂😂 Beautiful photo💛 👍 Mal ... muy mal ! ! 👎👎👎 I ’ m officially embarrassed for our species now .

"Love , love ❤️ I 'm really sorry to see Hyatt Gold Passport going away and being replaced by this sorry excuse of a program . With the M & A that 's been going on in hospitality and Hyatts small footprint , this should have been the time to capitalize on new customers by providing a more rewarding experience instead of making it even more difficult to be loyal to hyatt . Senior Management of Hyatt loyalty should be fired for not understanding the basics of gaining and retaining loyal customers . I 'll moving my business elsewhere I loved the way Hyatt made me feel special by being a diamond member . No reason to stay loyal to Hyatt now . The new website look great ! 👍 I love the how HYATT embraces diversity & I love the image displayed on your homepage right now . # hyatt4life ❤ I love staying at the Hyatt ❤ Congratulations for the launch of World of Hyatt 👌 saaaaweeeeet !

"Will you be a globalist if you stay 55 nights in a Hyatt Place in Oklahoma ? From there definition of a globalist.. Yes lol I 'll be nothing ! Your program sucks you can have your elite status back . Wow What completely awkward names Booo ! ! BRING BACK PLATINUM ! ! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 Sorry I 've been a huge fan for years and a longtime platinum ... But my loyalty will likely be somewhat lost because of these changes and continual devaluations . # CustomerUnfriendly Not a fan of the new names . What is wrong with platinum and diamond ? Not a good move Beautiful as a Longtime Diamond and now Lifetime Diamond I do n't like the new names Discoverist , Explorist and Globalist . The changes within the program itself is ok if hardly achieved Lifetime Diamond is now Lifetime Globalist . this guy here gives a lot of insights for people who have questions : http : //viewfromthewing.boardingarea.com/2016/10/27/confirmed-full-details-hyatts-new-elite-status-program-lot-previously-reported/ I have been a gold passport member since the 1980 's and a diamond for many of those years . This is a reduction in benefits and it will be harder to reach tiers . Hyatt should be apologing to its nembers not beagging about this . Not an honest presentation . This will likely cost Hyatt a lot of members once they understand . 💟 Awesome ❗ I 've been a diamond member for 15+ years and our family ( including our extended family ) is extremely Hyatt loyal . In fact I almost feel like a traitor if I stay at any other hotel and only do so when there 's not a Hyatt in the area which is rare . From what I 've seen so far it does seem like it 's going to be harder to achieve status and with that status lower benefits overall . Ca n't believe I 'm saying this but I 'm seriously going to start comparing Hilton versus Marriott Starwood to Hyatt programs . I 'm very anxious to see what my brother-in-law who is a courtesy card holder has to say about all of this as well . For those of you that are tonight you 're with the courtesy card program it is higher than diamond ... The last line was for those of you who are not familiar with the courtesy card program it is higher than diamond Great Post , check ours out ! 👏",0.9954,0.327,0.083,0.59,hyatt,515
"🎉🎉 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 got ta tell Jane 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼 see ! and what are the bennies ? ! # always5star That is the ugliest logo I have ever seen for a travel loyalty program . What is this ? 2nd grade ? ? ? Hyatt fail . I hope this is n't a way to screw us elite customers like most restructuring of loyalty programs is ... . Why make it harder to qualify for the equivalent of diamond ? 😂 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 The new logo is ugly as hell . The new elite status naming is ridiculous . With so less footprint , making it 55+ to qualify top tier status is absurd . LOVE this , friends ! 😍 Unless Hyatt counts award nights as qualified stays towards elite status , it 's getting hard to requalify in 2018 Lovely post I 'm concerned as I love the present program ! Where is the info on the changes ? # Always5star No a fan ... I am normally a huge fan of your chain but this is n't good . The penny pinchers are doing a little too much 👍🏻😍 Yes . With a tiny footprint , particularly in Australia and Europe beyond a few cities the higher threshold has me running back into the arms of # spg100 # spgambassadorkickshyattprivateline I very much dislike this new program . First of all , the new logo is uninspiring and ugly . And top tier status requirement is quite ridiculous seeing how there are barely any Hyatt Hotels to choose from when traveling . Loyal guests are already going out of their way to stay at a Hyatt and now you 're making it even harder on us . This is all about revenue as `` stays '' are no longer the requirement for status because only `` nights '' count . The new logo dosnt match you 're excellent Seems like a punishment .

"Oh man 😫😫😫  I want to go there ! ! Bunch of cowards and commies ; the Hyatt crew . All booked for next year ✈️☀️😍 😍😍😍 Absolutely beautiful Last time I stayed at Hyatt was for a 3 day grad getaway thing and it was horrible , they lost our reservation and we got stuck in a room with a very untidy bathroom . We were very disappoint . lets go Learn to respect the people who give you your freedom . TimeWarner : '' Faraway , so close '' Hey I 'd love it if you 'd watch my vlog on YouTube YouTube.com/favianquezada Es sind so mega tolle Zimmer !

"Great hotel ! Thank you , Hyatt ! We look forward to welcoming you back soon , .seattle ! 🌴☀️👋🏼 😢😢😭😍  almost babe almost Tira el cv Qué lindo ! ! ! ! 😍😍 la próxima semana estoy allá ! ! 😎 Hey , just mentioned this place ... Feeling a little # unbound ... ca n't wait to see it ! Absolutely beautiful 💯💯  Hey I heard you guys mistreat military am very saddened to hear of the mistreatment of an armed service member by your Hyatt at the French quarter . You will no longer be receiving me or my families business . Also any TDY in the future will be made certain not to reside at your establishments ... . What a sad excuse for a establishment . Learn your own policies you damn goons . I 'm going to avoid you now that I know you allow your employees to break your own rules . You guys mistreated a Army Ranger and American hero , you should feel ashamed , everyone take your money elsewhere # scum are you going to address your anti Constitution policies and your horrible treatment of veterans ? Hope all your hotels burn to the fucking ground No they 're going to ignore it like Hillary Clinton ignored the death of four Americans in Benghazi Never using Hyatt again Never again using Hyatt I 'll tell you that much and for damn sure I will let know all my friends and family to not use it as well good job pissing off a bunch of veterans and active duty service members . Incredibly disgusted with this company and their mistreatment of not only a US service member but a customer in general at the French Quarter Hyatt . To turn your back on your own company policies and leave a service member stranded on the 4th of July . What an absolute disgrace . I wo n't ever give you business again nor would I ever suggest anyone else do either . # unamerican # hyatthatesthetroops We were thinking about visiting in the near future . Unfortunately after finding out about how they treat combat veterans , I will never ever support this establishment . What a joke . you wo n't be getting any of my money in the future . It 's disgusting how you treated a vet and his family Hey thanks for stranding an American hero and that gave his sweat , blood and tears for the red , white and blue on our own Independence Day . I or anyone I know will never stay at one of your hotels ever again . PS . Your staff needs look up their P & P . you abandoned an American hero on the Fourth of July . He gave his sweat , blood , and tears for you , and you ca n't repay him . Extremely disrespectful and unamerican . You 'll never get my business again . Screw you . A man that risked his life for your freedom was denied service . And the sad part is is that he lost friends , and could have easily lost his life to give you the freedom to do so . And he would do it again in a heart beat , even though not letting him stay is against your gun policy . Классное фото , слов нет ! ! ! !

I ’ m here now and your team is the best !  😍❤️☺️ God with us 🙏  🙏❤️🙏 ❤️❤️❤️ 💙💙💙💙💙 Hope you guys help all of your employees affected by this 😞 ❤❤❤ Can ’ t wait ! I will be glad if the door open for me , as i am trying to enter and be with Hyatt for more than 10 years I was working in Hyatt but life goes bad with me so I left the country.. now I 'm back to the country and it 's my dream to go back again working with Hyatt because it was my pleasure and honor and best life work with them.. if I did n't have problems with my family traveling I would n't left my job in Hyatt ... have good day If you ever need a supply chain and logistics personnel position filled , just let me know.. I love your establishment ! .. Booked in April and May . Please take care of the team at Hyatt Regency Suites Atlanta NW . They are very caring and deserve to be supported . Looking forward to seeing the team there very soon . 7 years as a member ❤️ # Grateful # HyattHotelFan How about Hyatt does like Hilton and extends our Statues through 2022 ? 🙏 This is such a beautiful & hopeful post ! 🌞💙 if all of those employees featured are still with Hyatt , they are on an UNPAID leave of absence ! # profitsoverpeople ❤️ Where y ’ all at with paying your employees that have been laid off ? I booked a stay for a healthcare conference I was supposed to attend in May of 2020 . Due to the current pandemic , the conference is being moved to a different date and location . I called the hotel and tried to cancel my room but they are refusing to refund me because I did the prepay rate . I did the prepay rate because the conference rate wasn ’ t available and I only get a certain amount of money for continuing education from my employer . I am very upset that they aren ’ t doing anything to help when the conference is cancelled . I ’ m a healthcare provider and I am appalled at the lack of care or consideration . I have been on hold for over 20 minutes and no one has helped me . Both agents I ’ ve spoken to have been incredibly rude . Have a heart . This is out of my control . I had every intention of attending the conference but it ’ s been changed so I don ’ t see why they can ’ t just cancel my reservation and refund me given the circumstances . Missing my Hyatt family . Looking forward to getting back to work when this is over . I love Hyatt , God bless us all to return soon . Missed our # parkhyattmackapalas stay this month- but we will go back ! ! 💙 They 've fired employees with no warning during this pandemic rather than supporting them with the billions of dollars in their pockets . My family is now facing possible homelessness because of their greed . We 've lost everything because the Hyatt does n't care about its employees or their fake morals .",0.9998,0.361,0.059,0.58,holiday_inn,5
"Good Morning ! I have a Hyatt Place Miami Airport-West / Doral reservation for June 1 , 2020 . This reservation was made through a reservation website in Brazil , without cancellation . I would like to know if the hotel has a policy of not accepting guests and until when would that date be ? Because I need to know if the hotel is open or closed to the public to request a cancellation free of charge because it is not my fault that I probably should not travel remembering the situation that the world is experiencing due to COVID -19 .

I really wish I could have stayed with you later this month but thankful that you 're putting people 's safety first . Thanks ! ❤️❤️ Stay safe everyone My experience with customer service was not good at all . My family had plans to travel to Georgia for my sons tournament but due to the Coronavirus crisis the tournament was canceled . I made sure to call right away to cancel my reservation which was more than 24 hours before i was due to check in . They still charged me a night plus fees , I feel due to whats happening they should be more understanding . The Manager ( Michael ) from the hotel and his assistance ( Brittney ) were very rude and they seemed not to care for what I had to say . I tried calling several times and despite hearing over the recording of the Hotel that they were willing to wave the fee due to the Coronavirus they are not refunding me the money . All i got was points , I will never stay at this hotel . This experience was bad and I will make sure my family and friends will never reserve with them . I will stay with this company even more and make sure all my friends know to stay here as well because of your comment . 😂😂now that ’ s just beyond pathetic on your half . Grow up Shut up fake account . are employees being offered PAID sick leave ? ? # hyattcares no , they only told us we are laid off until further notice and to apply for unemployment since they can ’ t do anything about it . im sorry . very sad . billionaires have no empathy for “ normal ” people # profitsbeforepeople it is unfortunate , they told us our property will be close approximately two months . It ’ s devastating to work for a billion dollar company and they can ’ t even bother paying us during this time of need . It clearly shows how much they value us . furloughed is better than what we got . Outright fired , no option to return for us . .v.e.r.y.s.i I am so sorry to hear about that , that is devastating . I pray for you and everyone else affected by this tragedy . From what I hear , they 're not compensating employees for their impacted work schedules due to coronavirus ... ☹️ they 've fired my partner . We 've lost everything . My grandfather is 79 he called to reschedule or cancel his stay and he was told he could not and will loose his money and all his points ! ! ! any one that can help they have chronic diseases and due to the corona they did not want to be exposed . please respond My personal experience with Hyatt is that they don ’ t really care about their loyalty members . The seems care on the surface but when you experience deeper they are not . So since my bad experience I have switched from Hyatt to Marriott which truly cares . Have fun staying at a cheaper , less stylish , and less awesome hotel chain ! firing people right now while the is an epidemic going on is not helping the safety of people STOP FIRING EMPLOYEES DURING THIS VIRUS . We 've lost everything because of your greed . My experience with customer service was not good at all . My family Great reason . `` My family ...

"# MiravalMoments # Wellbeing # MiravalResorts 😍 😊 Lovely 💜 .escapes thanks ! Please consider updating your cancellation policy to extend refunds to advance payment reservations due to this outbreak . other hotels are offering refunds and Hyatt is offering a $ 150 credit . It is unfair Points shouldn ’ t expire ! I just lost my points because I didn ’ t stay at your place 😂 POINTS SHOULD NOT EXPIRE Hi there ! Points actually do not have an expiration date . You would just need to have some type of activity ( point movement ) at least once every 24 consecutive months in order to not forfeit the points within your account . Please feel free to visit our website for more information . Hello Hyatt ! What do you mean by `` point movement ? '' Just logging into your account within 24 months ? Or redeeming ( or adding to ) your points within 24 months , or they would be forfeited ? The latter Would essentially be the equivalent of expiring a persons earned points in 24 months of inactivity . That would be a 💩y practice . There is a pandemic and you guys won ’ t offer refunds to people who can ’ t travel . Truly terrible service . Not to mention incredibly irresponsible . My grandfather is 79 he called to reschedule or cancel his stay and he was told he could not and will loose his money and all his points ! ! ! any one that can help they have chronic diseases and due to the corona they did not want to be exposed .

Reinstated my room 🙅🏻‍♂️🙅🏻‍♂️🤔🤔🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ 😳 that ’ s bad service . , you seeing this ? I ’ ve tried several times to reach out . They keep saying since two weeks away I ’ m good . 🙅🏻‍♂️ I had to complain 40 times to them but they finally asked for my email , emailed me and said they would give 10,000 points for future use . Still not good enough IMO . I bet this offer has only gone out to select people who have complained a lot like myself . Even though it seemed like a broad distribution . I finally got my refund ! I had to ask about 50 times though . yes , and the points are all forfeited if people do n't use within 24 months . So shady . heard they are finally now going to issue refunds to everyone .

"# WorldofHyatt # FINDauction # FINDexperience Lovely 💜 .escapes 😊  Dear Hyatt Team , This email is regarding the poor customer experience during the stay at Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile . I checked in on 25 Feb and check out on 29 Feb . This was my honeymoon trip and Paris was my last destination and your team has messed up all thing . I have paid approximately 1000 Euro for the booking . Below is my experience day wise : Day 1 : I asked for the glasses and ice in my room , and i got the answer that go to the SKY bar they will give you the ice and glass . Is this the way hat you are going to treat the customers Day 3. : I returned from the Disneyland around 9 PM and found that the room was not properly cleaned . The dustbin was not empty , the table was dirty etc . Then I complaint the room service and they get the room clean again and apologise me for the same . Day : 4 I returned from the city tour and found that the door was opened of my room , there was the tag on door handle please make my room & cleaning was not proper again even after the yesterday complaint . I can not understand why the door was open and this was such a big negligence on your part and the room was not properly cleaned . I complaint the same at the reception then assistant front lobby manager came and he apologised me for the inconvenience and asked me that if I required anything , I simply asked for the English breakfast tea pouches along with the creamer and sugar in my room . He said that I am sending you this in few minutes and you know that few minutes actually never came . In morning at 7:30 AM I have to again call the room serve for the same . Is this how you treat your customers . I booked this property because of the brand name but it was my wrong decision . I will post my reviews on online platform also so that other customers can get the clear picture of what you show and what you actually deliver . We are very sorry to hear of your experience . As we are unable to assist via this channel , please send an email to consumeraffairs.com so we can follow up with you regarding your stay issues .",0.7717,0.153,0.116,0.731,holiday_inn,16

Несмотря на жутко испорченный график мы тем не менее не стали переезжать чтоб не упаковывать вещи обратно и оплатили ещё новогодний ужин 50тыс . Мало того , что зал для такого праздника выглядел как простая пустая комната в детском саду советских времён- ( там просто стоял экран и все ! ! ! ! ) на запрос все-таки прислали долгожданные новогодние фото- ОДНО СЕМЕЙНОЕ ФОТО ЗА 200 ТЫС !

Looks delicious 😋 .n_ you ’ ll have to join us at for a bite soon ! Looks fantastic . 👍 we agree ! 👍🏼 .parkerbrady Thanks ! ❤️ At the Duhau Palace Restaurant Buenos Aires , I was intoxicated with spoiled fish during lunch . My sister who is CELIAC received a dessert that had assured her that it was gluten free , and it turned out not to be . I have all the photos . Medical tests . The hotel really behaved badly . They were not even able to buy the prescribed medicines , which we asked for the favor , because we were not in condition . We were both suffering the consequences for more than a week . Why do I complain now ? Because at that time I was not in a position to enter on a battle . But I want you to know that despite having been informed Mr. Paupy , the Hotel never lived up to the circumstances . And every time I pass by I feel that unpleasant feeling and lack of education on behalf of the Duhau Palace . I hope some day they do something to repair such luck of respect to their own clients . Hello ! We would be happy to look into this situation on your behalf . Please email consumeraffairs.com for assistance . thank you very much for your interest , because the palacio Duhau Bloked me and erased my comment . 😍👏👏👏",0.9896,0.36,0.103,0.538,holiday_inn,90

"Love Hyatt but had an awful experience at Hyatt Pike in Long Beach and will never return to that location ! We are sorry to learn of your experience Please direct message us with more information so we can help you furhter . So this is still happening in India . My friends and I were at the Hyatt at 3am to eat and after that we were walking out and I had a rose in my hand from a friend who bought it from a kid selling roses outside a club we were at . The Hyatt security guy at the door tried to stop me saying I cant take the rose , to which I replied I got it from outside . By this time my friends were already in the cab waiting for me , so I got in too . Then another security guy came in front of our cab and asked us to get down and that we cant go without paying for the rose ! So I got down and asked to speak to the manager . Meanwhile the cab driver thought I had stolen something from the hotel so he asked my friends to get down from the cab . Then we were there for a long time talking to Seisa who said she was the manager . After almost an hour another guy walks in saying he ’ s the main manager and tried to pacify us asking if we want coffee or water after accusing me of stealing a rose ! After what felt like hours of humiliation , since there were guests walking in and out and were wondering if I actually maybe walked out without paying the bill or something of that equation , they eventually tried to get out of this situation by offering to drop us back in their hotel car . When I said I felt discriminated and racial profiled the manager decides to be cheeky by saying we have staff from the Northeast in our hotel . “ We are not racist ” Much to their dismay the Christmas tree that they thought I stole the rose from wasn ’ t even made of roses . It was made of red pine cones . At that hour we didn ’ t know what we wanted to make of the situation as we were exhausted and just wanted to go home and sleep . But today I know that what happened last night was wrong . And if I remain silent , many others who don ’ t fit their profile will be charged and faced with similar situation like we did . All this fuss over a rose ! After spending so much at dinner and my friends being a regular at their many restaurants , even if I had taken ONE rose , was this scene really necessary ? ! Feel the racism ! 😂😂 We take these matters very seriously . Please DM us with the property this took place at so that we can review further . They somehow have conveniently ignored the DMs and story tags . Kindly check you DM , its all mentioned there . # hyattregencydelhi Hyatt 's are great",0.854,0.183,0.144,0.673,holiday_inn,99

"# SmallLuxuryHotels Good evening , dear managers of Grand Hyatt . Right now me and my husband are spending our honeymoon in Grand Hyatt Bali , in Nusa-Dua . Yesterday ( 17.08.2019 ) we had a wedding day in Bali and got a marriage certificate which was thrown away today ( 18.08.2019 ) as a trash . The hotel , of course , denied everything . But how can one be so stupid to take the marriage certificate in wooden beautiful frame for a trash ! It has gone after the cleaning . We are just shocked and disappointed ! ! I am very sorry to hear that 's missing . Please direct message us so that we can better assist you.^JH please , be more specific , whom shall I direct the massage ?

"I have been on hold today for 20 minutes for the front desk of the Hyatt House Washington DC Wharf . They just keep picking and putting me back on hold . I ’ ve left 4 messages for Assistant Manager Michael Reeve . Every time I have called he is supposedly out of the office . I ’ ve been trying to talk to someone about a reservation for 10 days . Is there anyone in management that will talk to me ? Anyone answering the phones today ? We would be happy to assist . For security , we would need you to private message us your stay details , and how we can further assist.^JH I have stayed at this Hyatt hotel in Long Beach for nearly 30 years , 3 times a year . I ’ ve never once had a problem there and have enjoyed staying at this hotel until this incident . I was clearly wrongly charged a different rate for my room . After numerous talks with managers and Hyatt care on the phone I have come to the conclusion that Hyatt does not care at all about its loyal customers . Not only have I called multiple times about this incident but they did not call me back about this issue ever . I was promised this issue getting resolved by management and they treat their loyal customers like crap and can ’ t even get a call back to fix their problems . This is the last time I will stay at Hyatt Long Beach after almost 100 stays and I , my employees and everyone else that attends the convention connected to this hotel will know of the mistreatment that occurred between Hyatt and a loyal customer .

"👍 Like ! 👏🏾🕵🏽 Ohh delicious ! 👏 A yummy lineup ! Check dm ! X ❤️❤️❤️ I have had the worst customer service with Hyatt I had reservations that were changed by an employee and an unauthorized on my bank account . I am supposed to be surprising my mother who has an illness with this stay this weekend and no employee at or has apologized or accommodated me in any way . The only thing they did was refund my account and stated we fixed our mistake we don ’ t owe you anything . If I would have never called to confirm my stay I wouldn ’ t have any room to stay in . I am so pissed I am going back to from now on . You would think they would at least apologize , give free parking or breakfast but no . you suck and imma make sure everyone knows it until you learn some empathy and good customer service skills . I have had a worst experience at hyatt vastapur Ahmedabad",-0.0505,0.22,0.212,0.568,holiday_inn,370

"👍 This is so dope 👊🏼 😊👍 Top ! El dia 25 de agosto de 2018 , fuí víctima de un robo en el Hyatt House Miami Airport , donde alguien se introdujo a mi habitación , rompió mis 8 maletas y sustrajo prendas de valor , dinero , y ropa y zapatos nuevos que habia comprado ese día . La gerencia del hotel , fue amable , pero ineficiente , porque ya han pasado dos meses y aun no he obtenido repuesta alguna de parte de ustedes . Ya hice mis comentarios en booking.com y ahora los haré en tripadvisor , porque no es comprensible tanta desatención . La policía fué al hotel esa noche y realicé la denuncia , pero en el hotel no hay cámaras de seguridad y nadie me ha informado que fué lo que pasó . We are sorry to learn of this . Please direct message us with more of your stay information so , we can look into this . ^SB 🥂🥂🥂🥂🥂🥂 Great idea ! ❤ ❤️😍",0.8519,0.084,0.01,0.906,holiday_inn,377

Extremely incorrect work of the staff . The security service obtrusively offers services of women of easy virtue . I think for Bishkek Hyatt the name `` red-light hotel '' with three stars is more appropriate '' Hyatt plans to host an Act for America conference . This is the country ’ s largest anti-Muslim group and is labeled as a hate group . How is is it that many other hotel chains have been able to avoid serving white supremacist groups but Hyatt can not stand for the diversity they claim to champion ? why are you providing a safe space to hate groups like Act For America ?

Please call the phone number on the back of your current card and our Customer Service team will issue the new World of Hyatt credit card . 👍 too bad that the card is not available in Europe 👎🏻 or that you don ’ t have a european program.. How late does the event go ? just something to post next week if you need something I have a good screenshot of the benefits ! : ) Upgraded yesterday . New card is strong . Hyatt wake up ! Be fair to the European world of Hyatt members . I ask for a Hyatt credit-card since 9 years now.. What happens since that long time period ? In the meantime i have ordert a DKB Hilton honors credit-card which give you the gold status after you order the card and the Hilton diamond status after 20.000 euro sales per year .

Hi friend who do I talk to about daily fees ! I have a prepaid reservation through my employee at the grand Hyatt New York and to find out I have to pay 100 dollars a day when we are staying seven nights is absolutely ridiculous .

"paint a picture of a horse , not the horse itself . This can -and should be- considered animal cruelty . Please stop promoting this . As you can see from the comments above , it is n't doing any favors to the brand either . I 'm traveller and a travel consultant in Brazil , and finding this very dubious on If it 's a Nice experience or Just a way to sell something that is not actually good for both ways . I 'd like to know more about this and even see If i 'll offering this kind If thing , or Cross the hotel out . 👎🏼 WTF is this garbage . Disappointed in you , Hyatt . just wait till you hear about how they break into cars in the parking lot in the middle of the night . Paint horse ? ? ? Why hyatt why ! ! ! ! - it 's to distract people from the story that people at the Hyatt illegally search your vehicle . , you didn ’ t think this one through . Wtf Paint a horse , we raid through your car at 3 in the morning , for no justified reason , and when asked about it we will tell you it 's our right and to go away , walk a tightrope any comment about a night manger going through someone ’ s personal Lamborghini at the Hyatt Dallas last night ? That should never happen . You guys need to sort your staff out . 🤯 Does the horse get searched in the parking lot at 3 a.m. at your property too ? Or is that just patrons motorized vehicles in valet ? 🔵🔵🔵 Fuck you Hyatt . Why do n't you send over a manager , I 'll conduct an unauthorized search of their large colon Oh man that sounds cool ! I ca n't wait to do this while you illegally search my property ! Get all your stuff ripped out of you car in their parking lots across America .   you guys are fuckin scum bags and so are your employees how much to drive your guests lmabos Bankruptcy in 3.2.1. dont fuck with people 's lambos . Fuckin clowns Privacyyyyyy Shitty hotels and shitty employees don ’ t recommend Fuck Hyatt Shittest hotel Never again . Clearly violated that guests privacy and your response is insulting . Look at post about how you guys violated there privacy by breaking into there car You like invading people 's personal property # noprivacy # noprivacyathyatt Trash ... . I catch you going thru my shit.. no excuse needed 👊👊👊👊👊👊👊✋✌👌👊 Last time I stay there are you gon na have one of your valet ride that horse at 3am without the owners permission I sure as hell am never staying at one of your places . Illegally searching my shit just because you feel like it . that horse looks sketchy as shit . Better conduct and illegal search real quick . Scum bags . Why would we ever give our business to an agency who is okay with illegally searching our private property Just wondering if you guys let all your managers go through peoples personal vehicles at 3 am with no reason . Or if that ’ s only ? ? ? So do you guys let anyone search your guest ’ s cars ? Bullshit So , I wonder how much stuff is “ missing ” for valeted cars since your employees seem to have the right to just go through cars at 3am . Maybe a # metoo moment for everyone missing shit from their cars after staying at one of your places ? ! ? ! ? ! Fuck you talk done did it now caught your ads now ! ! So you guys have a policy of letting your employees illegally search your customers cars ? Illegally searching cars and now painting horses ... who is in charge ? really gon na stay quiet about your employees illegally searching customers vehicles in the middle of the night ? I know this hasn ’ t happened to just one persons car because your manager seems to know what they are talking about when it comes to them getting caught in the act So what ’ s up with breaking into people ’ s cars in the middle of the night ? Is that your standard business practice ? # BoyCottHyatt I can not believe you are defending your employees actions after they looked into a guest car parked in valet all because a cop wanted to check it out cause it was a lambo ? You need to put all your valet through training and with lawyers informing the employees of customers rights . Your employees had a duty to tell the curious cop no . I will NEVER stay at your hotels . What 's next letting a cop into a guest room without a warrant ? Did you thoroughly search this horse at 3am ? # jackasses 👎 searching people ’ s personal property is invasion of privacy . At least we now know where not to stay . First you invade someone ’ s privacy then abuse a horse ? Come on you retards ! ! ! ! Cool ! I was at the Hyatt place in 2016 it was great ! For a hockey tournament Dear Mark Hoplamazian , ask Dave if he remembers the signature # timburton # wynonaryder # piebald # fugazi # thepixies # u2 # weezer # thestrokes # modestmouse # pattismith 1980s style , black , ballet slipper that indie rock girls like Ida and Ani used to wear ? Those are much more comfortable for female employees feet than high heels .

I had a confirmation number and everything . I got to the hotel last night and they didn ’ t have a room for me . They offered me a room an hour away after a day if traveling . Then I refused and the manager offered me a cot in one of your conference rooms ! ! ! ! The common . I work for had 20 rooms at the hotel last night . Then to top it off the manager embarrassed me by calling security and threatening to call the police even though I never raised my voice once nor used profanity . I am appalled by the disrespect and lack of professionalism your hotel showed me and our business will look at other options in the Future . Shame on you . Once things became confrontational I began to record . Still considering sharing that footage . Paint a horse . Um , no . i can ’ t wait to see a pic of you doing this 😉 😂😂😂 girl I wanted to but wouldn ’ t budge on that one 😑🐴 .fernandez4 esto no es nada bueno no ? 🤔 white people 👎 blocked . 🙊 😂😂 Paint a horse 🐎 😂😂😂 ich bin froh wenn ich meine mal sauber krieg 😂😂 Beautiful photo💛 👍 Mal ... muy mal ! ! 👎👎👎 I ’ m officially embarrassed for our species now .

Absolutely loved # parkhyattbangkok great hotel , outstanding service ! ! ! 👌 lovely photo ! but most tuk tuk are tourist scammers 😭😭😭 we do love the tuk tuk There is no better way to get stuck in traffic , inhale very bad air and get frustrated over that instead of actually drive you where you eant to go , and agreed on , he now drives you to jewellery and gems outlets and hope you will buy something and he gets hus commission ! Avoid this , take the a/c BTS ( subway ) and MRT and be happy to arrive cool , fast and happy 😉 lol !

"Love , love ❤️ I 'm really sorry to see Hyatt Gold Passport going away and being replaced by this sorry excuse of a program . With the M & A that 's been going on in hospitality and Hyatts small footprint , this should have been the time to capitalize on new customers by providing a more rewarding experience instead of making it even more difficult to be loyal to hyatt . Senior Management of Hyatt loyalty should be fired for not understanding the basics of gaining and retaining loyal customers . I 'll moving my business elsewhere I loved the way Hyatt made me feel special by being a diamond member . No reason to stay loyal to Hyatt now . The new website look great ! 👍 I love the how HYATT embraces diversity & I love the image displayed on your homepage right now . # hyatt4life ❤ I love staying at the Hyatt ❤ Congratulations for the launch of World of Hyatt 👌 saaaaweeeeet !

"Will you be a globalist if you stay 55 nights in a Hyatt Place in Oklahoma ? From there definition of a globalist.. Yes lol I 'll be nothing ! Your program sucks you can have your elite status back . Wow What completely awkward names Booo ! ! BRING BACK PLATINUM ! ! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 Sorry I 've been a huge fan for years and a longtime platinum ... But my loyalty will likely be somewhat lost because of these changes and continual devaluations . # CustomerUnfriendly Not a fan of the new names . What is wrong with platinum and diamond ? Not a good move Beautiful as a Longtime Diamond and now Lifetime Diamond I do n't like the new names Discoverist , Explorist and Globalist . The changes within the program itself is ok if hardly achieved Lifetime Diamond is now Lifetime Globalist . this guy here gives a lot of insights for people who have questions : http : //viewfromthewing.boardingarea.com/2016/10/27/confirmed-full-details-hyatts-new-elite-status-program-lot-previously-reported/ I have been a gold passport member since the 1980 's and a diamond for many of those years . This is a reduction in benefits and it will be harder to reach tiers . Hyatt should be apologing to its nembers not beagging about this . Not an honest presentation . This will likely cost Hyatt a lot of members once they understand . 💟 Awesome ❗ I 've been a diamond member for 15+ years and our family ( including our extended family ) is extremely Hyatt loyal . In fact I almost feel like a traitor if I stay at any other hotel and only do so when there 's not a Hyatt in the area which is rare . From what I 've seen so far it does seem like it 's going to be harder to achieve status and with that status lower benefits overall . Ca n't believe I 'm saying this but I 'm seriously going to start comparing Hilton versus Marriott Starwood to Hyatt programs . I 'm very anxious to see what my brother-in-law who is a courtesy card holder has to say about all of this as well . For those of you that are tonight you 're with the courtesy card program it is higher than diamond ... The last line was for those of you who are not familiar with the courtesy card program it is higher than diamond Great Post , check ours out ! 👏",0.9954,0.327,0.083,0.59,holiday_inn,516
"🎉🎉 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 got ta tell Jane 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼 see ! and what are the bennies ? ! # always5star That is the ugliest logo I have ever seen for a travel loyalty program . What is this ? 2nd grade ? ? ? Hyatt fail . I hope this is n't a way to screw us elite customers like most restructuring of loyalty programs is ... . Why make it harder to qualify for the equivalent of diamond ? 😂 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 The new logo is ugly as hell . The new elite status naming is ridiculous . With so less footprint , making it 55+ to qualify top tier status is absurd . LOVE this , friends ! 😍 Unless Hyatt counts award nights as qualified stays towards elite status , it 's getting hard to requalify in 2018 Lovely post I 'm concerned as I love the present program ! Where is the info on the changes ? # Always5star No a fan ... I am normally a huge fan of your chain but this is n't good . The penny pinchers are doing a little too much 👍🏻😍 Yes . With a tiny footprint , particularly in Australia and Europe beyond a few cities the higher threshold has me running back into the arms of # spg100 # spgambassadorkickshyattprivateline I very much dislike this new program . First of all , the new logo is uninspiring and ugly . And top tier status requirement is quite ridiculous seeing how there are barely any Hyatt Hotels to choose from when traveling . Loyal guests are already going out of their way to stay at a Hyatt and now you 're making it even harder on us . This is all about revenue as `` stays '' are no longer the requirement for status because only `` nights '' count . The new logo dosnt match you 're excellent Seems like a punishment . You want us to switch back to spg/marriott ? how do I join ? ",0.9736,0.269,0.147,0.585,holiday_inn,517

We look forward to welcoming you back soon , .seattle ! 🌴☀️👋🏼 😢😢😭😍  almost babe almost Tira el cv Qué lindo ! ! ! ! 😍😍 la próxima semana estoy allá ! ! 😎 Hey , just mentioned this place ... Feeling a little # unbound ... ca n't wait to see it ! Absolutely beautiful 💯💯  Hey I heard you guys mistreat military am very saddened to hear of the mistreatment of an armed service member by your Hyatt at the French quarter . You will no longer be receiving me or my families business . Also any TDY in the future will be made certain not to reside at your establishments ... . What a sad excuse for a establishment . Learn your own policies you damn goons . I 'm going to avoid you now that I know you allow your employees to break your own rules . You guys mistreated a Army Ranger and American hero , you should feel ashamed , everyone take your money elsewhere # scum are you going to address your anti Constitution policies and your horrible treatment of veterans ? Hope all your hotels burn to the fucking ground No they 're going to ignore it like Hillary Clinton ignored the death of four Americans in Benghazi Never using Hyatt again Never again using Hyatt I 'll tell you that much and for damn sure I will let know all my friends and family to not use it as well good job pissing off a bunch of veterans and active duty service members . Incredibly disgusted with this company and their mistreatment of not only a US service member but a customer in general at the French Quarter Hyatt . To turn your back on your own company policies and leave a service member stranded on the 4th of July . What an absolute disgrace . I wo n't ever give you business again nor would I ever suggest anyone else do either . # unamerican # hyatthatesthetroops We were thinking about visiting in the near future . Unfortunately after finding out about how they treat combat veterans , I will never ever support this establishment . What a joke . you wo n't be getting any of my money in the future . It 's disgusting how you treated a vet and his family Hey thanks for stranding an American hero and that gave his sweat , blood and tears for the red , white and blue on our own Independence Day . I or anyone I know will never stay at one of your hotels ever again . PS . Your staff needs look up their P & P . you abandoned an American hero on the Fourth of July . He gave his sweat , blood , and tears for you , and you ca n't repay him . Extremely disrespectful and unamerican . You 'll never get my business again . Screw you . A man that risked his life for your freedom was denied service . And the sad part is is that he lost friends , and could have easily lost his life to give you the freedom to do so . And he would do it again in a heart beat , even though not letting him stay is against your gun policy . Классное фото , слов нет ! ! ! !

I do n't know why the newest hotel being built by in Portland , OR is hideous looking and going to be obnoxiously tall made of an ugly gold glass look which is not fitting to the PDX # vibes at all . Whoever the # architects are have no clue about what the neighborhood wants . The beautiful boutique hotels next door are welcomed because they did n't invade the neighborhood .

I wanted to know why Ramada Wyndham Princess Hotel in Belize City is saying unavailable rooms every single day of the year thru October ? ? ? She said because they 're sold out . I explained to her that ca n't be . I then told her the first agent I spoke to said bookings were suspended . She continued to speak over me and REFUSED to provide her managers name . The call was taken on speaker phone and my spouse heard the whole call . He was extremely upset at how I was hung up on by one agent and then berated by a `` SUPERVISOR '' . Her behavior makes me NEVER want to do business with the RAMADA or ANY WYNDHAM property . I spoke with FIVE people today . 3 were unable to help me , the 4th hung up on me because I asked why she is saying she needed to verify my phone number when I 've never even given it so she hung up . Back to Jenna , I want to file an official complaint and I will continue to write complaints on her until something is done . I am furious with the way I was treated by your stuff , ESPECIALLY a SUPERVISOR in customer care . I asked if she was a real supervisor and she said yes . I want a REAL manager to call me immediately. ! !",-0.6552,0.083,0.129,0.788,wyndham,35

So pretty ! I 'm providing more information about my mistake : ... .. I went to Orlando , Florida , in 2017 with my cousin and his family . After we got to the hotel , we were offered tickets if we go to a timeshare presentation . I did n't know anything about timeshare before that day , my cousin was interested in buying but he did no wanted to use his credit because he was trying to buy a house at that time , so Teresita Leiva ( The seller ) suggested that they can use my cousin 's credit card and my credit information to but , I wanted to talk about that in private with my cousin but she never gave us the chance to do it . I said ghat I left my wallet in the hotel and she said that she did n't want to lose us as clients and she take us in her personal car back to the hotel to get my wallet with the information . A couple of months later my cousin decided to stop making payments and now my credit is being affected . I hired a firm to help me getting out ( Resort Release ) and a few weeks ago I received a letter from them telling me that they filed bankruptcy . I 've lost almost 10,000 and I do n't know what else to do . I do n't have a stable job neither . PLEASE , HELP ! I have n't use the points , take them , take the payments I made also . I just want to get out of this . PLEASE ! # Wyndham # rewards # makesensefoundation # nike # ithappens # willienelson stunning photo ! ! # moveforward 🌊✨💦💦",0.9605,0.186,0.101,0.713,wyndham,72

We had a horrible experience at a Wyndham property and the manager there treated us like dirt , yelled and laughed at us . We complained to Wyndham customer service and their “ supervisors ” were a joke . They don ’ t have anyone above them to complain to so I filed a complaint with the BBB and Wyndham sent back a generic response that didn ’ t address the issue and offered us Wyndham rewards points as consolation . STAY AWAY ! There are so many other hotel companies with better customer service . We are organizing a group to act against the Wyndham company for incurring bad business practices that affect the economies of the families of Puerto Rico and the United States .

Naw makes me miss my mum and dad x Sent Dm xx FOR YOUR DTPHX LODGE* Rapists , thieves , and assassins = THE WHORES for chiefs past and present of Mexico , who are always on call , will appear here at any time to divert from and cover for the chiefs because they are conquering and plan on then bequeathing the southwestern US to their offspring . The name of the game is to make everyone who is opposed to the chiefs = THE NORMAL look like the threat . From a supremacist to a manslaughterer to a uni-bomber . This requires the creation of evidence ... A favored method is for some of THE WHORES to feign a domestic dispute filled with threats and sounds of violence and gore . When THE NORMAL call 911 , THE WHORES say THE NORMAL are making the whole thing up because , gasp , THE NORMAL are supremacists . When THE NORMAL do n't call 911 , THE WHORES claim that THE NORMAL just do n't care because , gasp , they 're supremacists . A no-win for THE NORMAL . Otherwise known as a JIGSAW . 1 ) Been there . Done that . You do this to THE NORMAL no matter the evidence they 're not the monsters you say . 2 ) You do n't do sh*t to help anyone other than fellow WHORES . Not even the little kids who are sexually traded at the properties owned by Arizona Housing INC . So who cares about you . 3 ) Go F yourselves , your crap evidence , and the chiefs you rode in on .

I was discriminated could u tell us what happened to u ? my privacy was invaded in the morning during my last stay in Seattle . Two painters were walking around on my balcony while I was getting out the shower and my blinds and balcony door was open . oh my god ! ! This hotel has not respect ! ! And now they don ’ t give you an apology or an answer ! Come on can you believe this ? ? And now they don ’ t answer ! ! ! can you believe this ? ? And now they don ’ t answer ! ! ! WE WILL BE HEARD ! ! ! ! Do what is right Currently staying at their property . They are not helpful at all.. Have already called housekeeping twice but no response . They refused our request for next door rooms even though the whole floor is empty . No one makes an attempt to understand what ur even trying to say . This is my second time visiting phuket and I feel sorry I could n't get a room elsewhere My fiancé and I reserved a room at Wyndham Virginia Beach Oceanfront for around $ 200 for a single night , which was deducted from our bank accounts before arrival . It took us a 8 hour drive to reach the hotels location check in was at 4pm I was told my room wasn ’ t ready multiple times had to wait two hours with out a reason not a single one , ( I am a person that works in the customer service and hospitality field everyday so i know and i ’ ve trained others the correct way do keep a customer satisfied ) . Due to the room delay we had to cancel our celebration dinner reservations which made everything else we had planned fall apart . we finally get to the 6th floor and first thing we see are trash bags all over the hallways , room service carts over flowing with dirty laundry , the hallways smelling similar to a men ’ s gym locker room not a single employee to be seen ( stayed like this for about 3 hours unacceptable ) but i wasn ’ t going let the only night we both had off work go to waste we paid for a ocean front view only thing i wanted to see was the sunset , my fiancé goes to open the balcony door about 15 midges flies rush into our room and 2 cockroach 's run in-front of her feet causing her to drop her phone an Iphone Xs max from being frighten at which cause the whole back of the phone to break into pieces called the front desk multiple times that night and no one answered had to spend 20 mins in a hotel room trying to kill all of the insects . My night of relaxing and celebration turned into the most awful experience of my life a total nightmare . The phone breaking cost more then the room we stayed in , I have a big family and a lot of friends that love to travel i ’ ll be sure that everyone knows how the wyndham hotel really is before they decide to book a room here . 3 weeks later and still no response from a privacy dispute we had at the Seattle property .

They do offer you a smaller trial package after the session , and tell you everything that you wanted to hear , but the nightmare comes later . You get a bill that was not as promised . You get a package that was n't as promised . You try calling them but was ignored for three weeks . They starts to charge you late payment because you ca n't find someone to handle your contract . Conclusion , avoid Wyndham Timeshares . I 'm going to make a trip down personally during their timeshare sessions , if no one calls me back this week . Beautiful BE FOREWARNED : Horrible experience @ your Fishers Indiana Americinn ! Will never stay here again and will warn everyone I know against staying here , First we show up 20 minutes early and were rudely told we would have to wait because no rooms were ready , ok cool so we get checked in finally and I always ensure a property is ev friendly before I stay , I was assured that we would have a place to plug our car when I made my reservation but upon check in was told the only open outlet was by the building and I could plug in there but the cops would probably ticket me ... .are you serious ? Next morning now and I decide to use the Jacuzzi in our room which I paid extra specifically to use . I fill with water , turn on and it blows this nasty black lent/hair stuff out so I could n't even use it . I bring my complaint to the front desk and I 'm shittily told to calm down by the girl there in a loud rude tone . I do customer service for a living , I never once raised my voice or cursed at her for such a reaction . I asked for a manager and ironically there was not one to talk to . Very disappointed with what was supposed to be a special birthday trip for my husband : ( # Wyndham",0.3612,0.13,0.107,0.762,wyndham,115

"🙏🙏🙏 Do n't waste your money on a Wyndham property , their customer service is abysmal . They do nothing to protect their customers from shoddy property managers . Wasted $ 130 of my money on a room that was falling apart , had pubes in the bathroom and a peeping Tom property manager who looked into my room and then called us to accuse us of having sex with the shade open . The customer service response from Wyndham was `` we 'll let the property manager handle this '' . Cool , thanks for letting a dirty peeping Tom hotel manager keep my money . We only stayed until 6pm , there 's no way that room was empty all night . Not wasting my money on this Brand ever again . # disappointed # dirty # disgusting I see I 'm not the only one making complaints about properties on your insta page . Looks like it is common occurrence at a Wyndham property to have a dirty , disgusting room . Not ever patronizing one of your properties again . We wouldn ’ t mind working from there ! Onde fica ? O que tem a noite para fazer ?",-0.9704,0.079,0.273,0.648,wyndham,137
"Thank you for sharing 🙌🏼☺️ HOWARD JOHNSON BY WYNDHAM , FULLERTON LOCATION : The ultimate worst experience anyone can have as a customer ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE , HORRID HOTEL MAINTENANCE AND ROACHES . When we arrived Thursday night we checked in and dropped off our belongings . We were in the room for less then 10 minutes , it had a really bad odor so I mentioned to front desk before leaving for Disney and they said they would send someone to deodorize the room . We come back later that night around 2AM , our keys weren ’ t working so Daniel the man working sent some third party security guard to try using several keys to open the door and nothing seemed to work . I don ’ t think professional is in this hotels vocabulary because No manager was available at the time or anytime , so there only solution was to put us in a different room without our stuff until 7AM when the maintenance guy would be available . I argued that we needed our stuff and how inconvenient this was , the guy acted like it was normal and didn ’ t put any effort into making us feel like we would be taken care of . They had us waiting in the lobby while his manager walked him through steps to get door open , instead of Putting us in a room first he had us waiting at almost 3AM . The manager should have shown on the spot . Too top it off , my daughter was with us and they had her eating outside in there hallway while we waited for them to fix the door before lobby . We were forced to sleep in another room with none of our stuff . On our way to the other room 3 cockroaches run passed me . That was the cherry on top of the lack of customer service and professionalism . I get a call in the morning by Mariel , who says we can return to the room with our belongings . Now , I ’ m thinking your trying to put me back in the same room I got locked out of , how is that even an option . I ask Mariel for a refund of our stay and she stated we would have to wait until 11AM for manager to arrive , now what I don ’ t understand is why is the customer Waiting for people to do there jobs correctly . She also didn ’ t make us feel comfortable or taken care of . We have already planned on leaving the minute we get our stuff but the simple fact was they expected us to stay in that room again , which still had a really bad odor . After several attempts of complaining to corporate , which also lacked the customer service , stated they can ’ t authorize anything but a complaint that would give the hotel a week to resolve not now but a week . I go back at 11AM expecting to speak with a manager , nope ! The manager was in a “ meeting ” . Never got a call or spoke with any management in person . NO MANAGER OR EMPLOYEE EVER APOLOGIZED . We did get our cash refund and I was relieved that nightmare was over . BUT NO , I get an email from them stating they charged my card 178.64 , and it will be refunded to card on file . I was confused cause my room was paid with cash for $ 256.08 , which was refunded . I never enforced why I was charged the extra 178.64 with NO CONSENT , because I don ’ t wan na deal with the lack of knowledge that the people have at this hotel . Or waste anymore time and energy from my vacation time on them . All I know is the refund better be valid . Otherwise don ’ t even waste your time or money with rude and dirty environment . Definitely not kid friendly or friendly at all ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! WORST PLACE EVER ! ! ! ! ! Went to a time share presentation in Las Vegas on 5/23 . We were lied to repeatedly about the discovery package , we were lied to about the perks telling us we could get money off our Verizon and directv bill , both blatant lies , the perks are a joke . We were told we could book Wyndham affiliated hotels and motels with our points , blatant lie as we can only use `` rewards points '' . We were NOT told that there is a 3 night minimum for booking resorts . We were NOT told that everything books up 10 months ahead of time and we must book our vacations 10 months ahead of time . We were told it would be $ 91 dollars a month , another LIE because that did n't include the stack of interest charges making it over $ 20 a month more . We were told we would be contacted by someone to set up our account online and after 5 days of not being contacted we decided to look into it ourselves , when we discovered all these lies we wanted out . When we looked into a refund turns out you must cancel within 5 days , and the 6th day was n't good enough . IF YOU GO TO A TIMESHARE PRESENTATION JUST SAY NO NO NO . I could see through the sales pitch like glass , but the blantant disgusting LIES we were told is something I was not aware of at the time . And now we are stuck with this B.S . package we have no interest in because it is n't even remotely close to what we were led to believe . Avoid Wyndham at all costs for not only the salesman lying but for also denying our request to get a refund despite us illustrating the lies .",-0.9853,0.125,0.184,0.691,wyndham,138

"😍😍😍😍 I will NEVER book with ANY Wyndham properties ! We attended a time share presentation last year in Orlando , FL . Were told they needed only 60 minutes of our time which turned into almost 3 hours and rude employees once they realized we weren ’ t interested in purchasing a timeshare . Finally received the promised vacation reward certificate for a future stay ( which we still paid $ 50 for ) ... went to use certificate today for a trip this Summer after spending hours online and calls in to customer service . There was only 1 property available which required an upgrade fee of almost $ 1,500—could not use it towards any other properties along with our 3,000 “ bonus points ” that were also not valid because apparently you need at least 15,000 pts to apply towards a stay . Customer service solution : “ Sorry , I know this isn ’ t what you want to hear but I can ’ t really help you ! ” Too many other amazing hotel chains to choose from . This was 💯 % a scam . Did the same to us . Come to find out their points just happen to double the day we wanted to book a trip . Shady company ! Will NEVER stay again . SCAMMERS ! ! ! !

"Man-oh-man so for the past 12 years my mom has one of your time shares , it ’ s paid off but now there ’ s a “ maintenance fee ” of sorts that I guess yawl convinced her to sign up for during some budget complimentary green eggs and ham breakfast .

The room had n't been cleaned and there were filthy socks in the the middle of the floor and the furniture was worn and had several stains . No one called nor came to the room to assist . Saturday , I did n't feel well so I laid there most of the day , when I went to take a bath later that night..I discovered that the water was brown coming from the faucet..I let it out and repeated that 3 more times with the same result..I turned the water on in the bathroom sink and that water was also brown..still the Hotel did not move me or offer a refund..on Sunday I called again but no one came..I left the room and ran into a housekeeper and I asked her when was the last time the room had been cleaned ? She informed me that someone had cleaned it..Now that perplexed me because if i This post made me smile ! So here is a 🧚‍♀️ fairy .

Our stay was nothing short of horrendous . Not only do you arrive to a beautiful lobby only to turn the corner and the hotel seems run down and out dated , but the breakfast was also horrible and costed us $ 10 . The only thing edible was the watered down coffee . If these were my only complaints I would let it go , but within the first day of staying there we returned to our room and found our things rummaged through . The room had barely been cleaned ( only one bed made , empty water bottles still laying about , no fresh towels ) and the money and gift cards in my wallet had been stolen . I immediately went to the front desk to complain and was turned around and told there was only one man there at the time that could do nothing and to come back again in the morning , so I did . I returned in the morning and complained once more to the front desk manager . The whole situation was sketchy . The people at the desk did not act surprised at all by my complaint , nor did they seem to care very much . The woman only made a report and said she would get back to me after telling her boss , she never did . It has been over a month since my stay and I have still yet to hear a word from them . We have called and complained multiple times and get the same response every time , but nothing is ever done about it . I will never be going back to this hotel , or recommending it to anyone . I hope this is helpful for anyone thinking about staying in one of these establishments . love it ! : )",0.7889,0.145,0.109,0.745,wyndham,251

"Nice stay ! 😊 # awesomeness 👋👍 I stayed at the Wyndham hotel in Williamsburg Virginia over a month ago . Our stay was nothing short of horrendous . Not only do you arrive to a beautiful lobby only to turn the corner and the hotel seems run down and out dated , but the breakfast was also horrible and costed us $ 10 . The only thing edible was the watered down coffee . If these were my only complaints I would let it go , but within the first day of staying there we returned to our room and found our things rummaged through . The room had barely been cleaned ( only one bed made , empty water bottles still laying about , no fresh towels ) and the money and gift cards in my wallet had been stolen .

Not only do you arrive to a beautiful lobby only to turn the corner and the hotel seems run down and out dated , but the breakfast was also horrible and costed us $ 10 . The only thing edible was the watered down coffee . If these were my only complaints I would let it go , but within the first day of staying there we returned to our room and found our things rummaged through . The room had barely been cleaned ( only one bed made , empty water bottles still laying about , no fresh towels ) and the money and gift cards in my wallet had been stolen . I immediately went to the front desk to complain and was turned around and told there was only one man there at the time that could do nothing and to come back again in the morning , so I did . I returned in the morning and complained once more to the front desk manager . The whole situation was sketchy . The people at the desk did not act surprised at all by my complaint , nor did they seem to care very much . The woman only made a report and said she would get back to me after telling her boss , she never did . It has been over a month since my stay and I have still yet to hear a word from them . We have called and complained multiple times and get the same response every time , but nothing is ever done about it . I will never be going back to this hotel , or recommending it to anyone . I hope this is helpful for anyone thinking about staying in one of these establishments .",-0.3022,0.117,0.123,0.76,wyndham,310

Not only do you arrive to a beautiful lobby only to turn the corner and the hotel seems run down and out dated , but the breakfast was also horrible and costed us $ 10 . The only thing edible was the watered down coffee . If these were my only complaints I would let it go , but within the first day of staying there we returned to our room and found our things rummaged through . The room had barely been cleaned ( only one bed made , empty water bottles still laying about , no fresh towels ) and the money and gift cards in my wallet had been stolen . I immediately went to the front desk to complain and was turned around and told there was only one man there at the time that could do nothing and to come back again in the morning , so I did . I returned in the morning and complained once more to the front desk manager . The whole situation was sketchy . The people at the desk did not act surprised at all by my complaint , nor did they seem to care very much . The woman only made a report and said she would get back to me after telling her boss , she never did . It has been over a month since my stay and I have still yet to hear a word from them . We have called and complained multiple times and get the same response every time , but nothing is ever done about it . I will never be going back to this hotel , or recommending it to anyone . I hope this is helpful for anyone thinking about staying in one of these establishments .",0.416,0.127,0.112,0.76,wyndham,343
"such a horrible experience with your Syracuse ny Ramada for my daughter ’ s birthday . We originally were going to the embassy suites but there pool was down so we go down the street to your hotel . They tell me I have to rent another room because I was two over for capacity for my room . Mind you all the kids weren ’ t even staying over ! ! ! ! So , that means they won ’ t let all the kids swim ! ! ! ! Horrible experience and they ruined my daughter ’ s birthday . Never again will I frequent this hotel or recommend Cute how yall post a pic of a boy with his pet , but dont allow service dogs into your establisments which is against federal law .

I used to love it so much until a series of bad experiences that I have had recently . They have some deceptive practices with their promotions . I completed the requirements to one recently and was told there was nothing that could be done because I did not `` register '' by clicking a button on their website . Makes no sense because literally no other additional information was required . Some way to treat a loyal member ... seems more like a ploy to generate more business at the expense of their members . I was planning on doing a week long trip in Boston staying exclusively at their hotels but now that plan will be compromised . I was very disappointed that they could not make an exception for me . I also have a Wyndham visa card as well and I think this might just about do it for me I do n't really have much of a desire to give them anymore of my hotel business . I would not recommend the rewards program or the visa card at all . That would have been different had I received better customer service , but I 'm not keeping my hopes up .

Our stay was nothing short of horrendous . Not only do you arrive to a beautiful lobby only to turn the corner and the hotel seems run down and out dated , but the breakfast was also horrible and costed us $ 10 . The only thing edible was the watered down coffee . If these were my only complaints I would let it go , but within the first day of staying there we returned to our room and found our things rummaged through . The room had barely been cleaned ( only one bed made , empty water bottles still laying about , no fresh towels ) and the money and gift cards in my wallet had been stolen . I immediately went to the front desk to complain and was turned around and told there was only one man there at the time that could do nothing and to come back again in the morning , so I did .

I stayed at the Wyndham hotel in Williamsburg Virginia over a month ago . Our stay was nothing short of horrendous . Not only do you arrive to a beautiful lobby only to turn the corner and the hotel seems run down and out dated , but the breakfast was also horrible and costed us $ 10 . The only thing edible was the watered down coffee . If these were my only complaints I would let it go , but within the first day of staying there we returned to our room and found our things rummaged through . The room had barely been cleaned ( only one bed made , empty water bottles still laying about , no fresh towels ) and the money and gift cards in my wallet had been stolen . I immediately went to the front desk to complain and was turned around and told there was only one man there at the time that could do nothing and to come back again in the morning , so I did . I returned in the morning and complained once more to the front desk manager . The whole situation was sketchy . The people at the desk did not act surprised at all by my complaint , nor did they seem to care very much . The woman only made a report and said she would get back to me after telling her boss , she never did . It has been over a month since my stay and I have still yet to hear a word from them . We have called and complained multiple times and get the same response every time , but nothing is ever done about it . I will never be going back to this hotel , or recommending it to anyone . I hope this is helpful for anyone thinking about staying in one of these establishments .",0.416,0.124,0.11,0.767,wyndham,377
